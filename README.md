# The Rhino database

An in-memory database written in pure Rust <br />
More specifically, a server written using the **Actix Web** framework

(Still under development)


# To do
<ol>
  <li /> Add file storage support and sync with memory to prevent data loss
  <li /> Add security features like ip address permissions, password locking etc
  <li /> Make a url scheme, something like rhino://localhost:3000 ( is that even possible? )
</ol>
